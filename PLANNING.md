# Planning

## Wireframe

- What does my app look like from my user's perspective?
  ![First Wireframe](../Week7-Assignment/client/public/images/First-Wireframe.png)

## Plan your database schema

- What data do I need to store?
  - I need to store a guests name, feedback, date of the feedback and rating out of 10
- Based on the data how many tables do I need to oraganise my date efficiently?
  -For a mvp I will only have one table called comments
  - Stretch goal would be to add 2 more tables one for rating and one for date so that I can sort the comments by either of those
- What is the relationship between them if you have more than one table?
- How do I connect the tables - foreign keys, junction tables.
- ** Set up you tables in a database in Supabase **
  - create a project (database)
  - use sql editor to create your tables and insert seed data
    - you can also add these to your seed.js later
